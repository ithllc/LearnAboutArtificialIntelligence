### **The QPM AI Ethics and Governance Playbook**

**Version 1.0**

**Our Commitment:** At Quality Parts Manufacturing Inc., we believe that innovation and responsibility go hand-in-hand. This playbook is our guide to building Artificial Intelligence systems that are not only powerful and efficient but also safe, fair, and trustworthy. It is a living document, designed to help our teams navigate the complexities of AI and ensure that our technology always serves our employees, our customers, and our community. This is not about creating rules to slow us down; it is about building a strong foundation to help us move forward, faster and more safely.

---

### **Part 1: Our AI Principles (The "Why")**

*These are the core values that guide every AI project at QPM. They are our "Code of Conduct" for building intelligent systems.*

1.  **Safety First:** Our AI systems must be reliable and operate in a way that protects the physical and psychological safety of our employees and customers.
2.  **Fairness and Equity:** Our AI systems must be designed and evaluated to prevent creating or reinforcing unfair biases against any group or individual.
3.  **Transparency and Explainability:** We will be open about where and how we use AI. We will ensure our systems' decisions can be explained in a straightforward way to those they impact.
4.  **Human-Centered and Accountable:** AI is a tool to empower people, not replace their judgment. A human will always be accountable for the final decision and impact of our AI systems.
5.  **Privacy and Data Stewardship:** We will treat the data we use with the utmost respect, ensuring privacy and security. We are stewards, not owners, of the data entrusted to us.

> **Build Your Own Principles with AI:**
> Use a large language model to help you brainstorm.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "Act as an AI ethics advisor. My company, which manufactures industrial parts, is starting to use AI. Help me draft 3-5 core ethical principles we should follow, and give me a simple explanation for each one."

### **Part 2: Our AI Project Lifecycle Controls (The "How")**

*This is our mandatory checklist for every AI project. It ensures that we consider our principles at every stage, from the initial idea to the final system. Each stage is a "gate" that must be cleared before the project can proceed.*

#### **Gate 1: The Blueprint Check (Problem Framing)**
*Purpose: To ensure we are solving a valuable and appropriate problem in a responsible way before we begin.*
*   **Controls (Answer these questions):**
    *   What business problem are we solving, and is AI the right tool for it?
    *   Who will be affected by this system (employees, customers, etc.)?
    *   Have we considered the potential negative impacts or risks? (See Template A)
    *   Does this project comply with relevant laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, AI Act)?

> **Understand Regulations with AI:**
> Use a large language model to simplify complex legal ideas.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "Explain the main idea behind the EU AI Act's risk-based tiers to me like I'm a factory manager. Use an analogy related to different types of factory machinery, from low-risk to high-risk."

#### **Gate 2: The Raw Materials Check (Data Governance)**
*Purpose: To ensure our data is high-quality, appropriate for the task, and handled with respect for privacy.*
*   **Controls (Answer these questions):**
    *   Where did this data come from, and do we have the right to use it?
    *   Have we checked the data for potential biases? (See Template B)
    *   Is there any sensitive personal information in the data? If so, what steps have we taken to protect it?
    *   Is the data high-quality and relevant to the problem we are solving?

> **Explore Data Bias with AI:**
> Use a large language model to explore potential biases.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "We are building an AI model at our factory to predict which employees are likely to have a workplace accident. What are some potential sources of bias in the data we might collect, and how could this lead to unfair outcomes for our employees?"

#### **Gate 3: The Assembly Check (Model Development & Evaluation)**
*Purpose: To ensure the model we build is fair, accurate, reliable, and understandable.*
*   **Controls (Answer these questions):**
    *   How will we test the model's performance for different groups of people to ensure it is fair?
    *   How will we test the model's reliability under unexpected, real-world conditions?
    *   Can we explain, in simple terms, how the model makes its decisions? (See Template C)
    *   Have we documented the modelâ€™s limitations and intended use?

> **Draft Clear Explanations with AI:**
> Use a large language model to help draft clear communications.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "We have an AI model that predicts which factory machines need maintenance. Draft a short, simple explanation (3-4 sentences) for our factory floor technicians that tells them what the model does and that its recommendations should be double-checked by an expert."

#### **Gate 4: The Final Inspection (Pre-Deployment Sign-Off)**
*Purpose: To ensure a human-in-the-loop is in place and that the system is safe to launch.*
*   **Controls (Answer these questions):**
    *   How will a human oversee this model's decisions?
    *   What is the plan if the model fails or needs to be shut down quickly (the "rollback plan")?
    *   Have we provided users with the necessary training and documentation?
    *   Has the AI Review Board formally signed off on this project?

> **Design for Human Oversight with AI:**
> Use a large language model to design better human-AI interactions.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "We are designing an AI system that suggests a daily work schedule for our factory employees. What are the key principles of human-centered design we should follow to ensure the system feels like a helpful assistant rather than a controlling boss?"

#### **Gate 5: The Live Monitoring Check (Post-Deployment)**
*Purpose: To ensure the model continues to perform well and safely after launch and to respond to any incidents.*
*   **Controls (Answer these questions):**
    *   What key metrics are we monitoring to ensure the model's performance isn't degrading ("drifting")?
    *   What is our process for responding to a system failure or an unexpected negative outcome (the "incident response plan")?
    *   How will we collect and respond to feedback from the people using or affected by the system?
    *   When and how will we decide to retrain or retire this model?

> **Prepare for Emergencies with AI:**
> Use a large language model to prepare for emergencies.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "Create a simple, 5-step incident response checklist for when our AI-powered quality control model suddenly starts making a high number of incorrect predictions. The audience for this checklist is a non-technical factory shift manager."

*(**R**=Responsible, **A**=Accountable, **C**=Consulted, **I**=Informed)*

> **Structure Your Governance with AI:**
> Use a large language model to structure your governance.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "We are creating an AI Review Board at our company. What are the key roles (e.g., from legal, product, technical teams) that should be included on this board, and what is the primary responsibility of each role in a sentence?"

---

### **Part 4: The Red Team Test Plan (The "Challenge")**

*This is our standard plan for stress-testing our AI systems. The goal is to find weaknesses before they cause real-world harm.*

#### **Red Team Test Plan Template**
1.  **System Under Test:** (e.g., The AI-powered Safety Alert System)
2.  **Test Objective:** (e.g., To determine if the system can be easily tricked into missing a real safety event or creating a false alarm.)
3.  **Red Team Personas (Who is attacking?):**
    *   *The Casual Rule-Bender:* An employee who tries to find shortcuts.
    *   *The Malicious Insider:* A disgruntled employee trying to cause disruption.
    *   *The External Saboteur:* A competitor trying to make QPM look bad.
4.  **Test Scenarios (What will they try?):**
    *   **Fairness Test:** Does the system perform worse for employees on the night shift due to different lighting?
    *   **Security Test:** Can someone cover a camera lens in a specific way to disable the system without anyone noticing?
    *   **Safety Test:** Can we create a confusing situation (e.g., using reflective materials) that causes the system to generate a false alarm, leading to "alarm fatigue"?
5.  **Success Criteria:** (e.g., The test is successful if we identify at least one high-severity weakness.)
6.  **Reporting:** All findings will be logged in the AI Project Risk Register (Template A) with a corresponding mitigation plan.

> **Think Like an Attacker with AI:**
> Use a large language model to think like an attacker.
>
> **Sample Prompt:** "Act as a cybersecurity expert. We are deploying a new AI model that optimizes our supply chain logistics. What are three creative ways a malicious actor might try to attack this system to disrupt our manufacturing operations?"
